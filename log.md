##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: February 17, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on Codewars. I started with 8 kyu katas and completed one 6 kyu as well.

**Thoughts**: For the past one week, I have been focused on building more solid understanding of JavaScript basics. I can definitely feel it has improved my overall confidence with the language.

### Day 2: February 18, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I continued with Codewars - 7 kyu. 

**Thoughts**: I took time to think of other ways to approach some of the exercises (e.g. instead of using traditional for loop, I tried using 'for...of...' with arrays). I have also completed one of the exercises previously with Python so it was interesting to compare the solutions.
